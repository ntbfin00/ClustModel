ClustModel
============
This code calculates the line of sight velocity and disperision for galaxy tracers in a cluster.

#### INPUT:
- Projected positions of galaxy tracers (in arcsecs)
- M200 and R200 of cluster DM halo  (in Msun and pc)
- Anisotropy parameters for cluster

#### OUTPUT:
- Line of sight velocities and dispersions (km/s)
